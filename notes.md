# Notes on Angular 6

- `AppComponent` is the component thet manage the app shell. The _shell_ cotains all other parts of the app.

- Components are building block of an app. To generate a component, use this command.
```bash
ng generate component myComponentName
```

- It generates a sub-folder containing the code of the new componenet.Basically we have 3 files/parts in a componenent:
  - .ts file with contains the logic written in TypeScript
  - .html file for the html code
  - .css file for styling the component
